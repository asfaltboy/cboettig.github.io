Notebook Archiving & Data Management
====================================

The lab notebook is written and maintained in plain text (UTF-8) using markdown. All files are kept in a version managed repository system using [git](http://git-scm.com/), which provides unique SHA hashes to protect against corruption. Synchronized backups of the git repository are maintained on both local and remote servers (RAID 6) to protect against hardware failures, as well as on the public international software repository, Github [github.com/cboettig](https://github.com/cboettig).  Version history preserves a time-line of changes and protects against user error.  Archival copies of notebook entries shall be published annually to [figshare](http://figshare.com) where they will be assigned DOIs and preserved by the [CLOCKSS](http://www.clockss.org/clockss/Home) geopolitically distributed 12 node global archive.




Building from source
====================

This site is built by Jekyll, a static site generator which creates html pages from markdown files.  Here are the instructions for building the site from source, based on my Ubuntu 12.04 platform.  Feel free to adapt this configuration to your own needs.  

Clone the site source-code from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook.git
```


Install Ruby version >= 1.9

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-full
```

Make sure the [latest version is selected](http://askubuntu.com/questions/91693/how-do-you-uninstall-ruby-1-8-7-and-install-ruby-1-9-2)

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config ruby
sudo update-alternatives --config gem
```

Install Jekyll and the dependencies needed for a few plugins.

```bash
sudo gem install jekyll redcarpet2 feedzirra nokogiri twitter octokit pandoc-ruby
```


In the root directory of the project, run `jekyll --server`, if successfull, after a few seconds the site should be available by pointing your browser to `localhost:4000`.  The additional gems are required for various plugins; see below for more information.  Due to these additional requirements, this site cannot be automatically rendered on Github's pages.  Compile the site locally and copy the html files in `_site` to the `gh-pages` branch of a Github repository for Github-based hosting.  

Jekyll Dependencies 
-------------------

The site relies on following additional ruby gems (not available on the Jekyll copy provided on Github's gh-pages) to compile successfully.  

#### Required Gems

* [redcarpet2](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/) -- Providing support for [Github-flavored markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)
* [feedzirra](https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra) -- Grab and format rss feed information  
* [nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri) -- parse HTML and XML 
* [twitter](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) Ruby bindings to the Twitter API
* [octokit](https://github.com/pengwynn/octokit) Ruby bindings to the Github API
* [pandoc-ruby](https://github.com/alphabetum/pandoc-ruby) Ruby implementation of pandoc markdown interpreter (an alternative to redcarpet2)



#### Third Party Plugins 

Plugins are provided in the site source, so cloning this repository will give you a copy of them. In addition to my own plugins, I'd like to credit other developers for the following plugins:

* [redcarpet2 plugin](https://github.com/nono/Jekyll-plugins)
* [pandoc](https://github.com/dsanson/jekyll-pandoc-plugin)
* [redirects](https://github.com/pelosi/marran.com/blob/master/_plugins/redirects.rb)
* [tag-cloud](https://gist.github.com/2290195) 
* my own custom [jekyll-plugins](https://github.com/cboettig/jekyll-labnotebook-plugins)
