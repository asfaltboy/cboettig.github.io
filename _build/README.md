## Overview

## Use

From the root directory of the Jekyll project repository, 
use the volumes option, `-v` to link the current working 
directory to the `/data` directory on the container:

```
docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data cboettig/labnotebook
```

This will run the default command (a call to `servr::jekyll` with
appropriate options) to run the R code and build the Jekyll site according
to the configuration.

The Docker container includes only general-purpose software required
to build the site (R and Ruby), all the site content, layout etc is
not included in the container. As such, this container also works as
a general-purpose swiss-army knife; simply provide the desired
command to override the default. For example:

An R shell:

```
docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data R 
```

Pandoc: 

```
docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data pandoc
```

jekyll server: 

```
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/data jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0
```


bash: 

```
docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data bash 
```

latex: 

```
docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data pdflatex file.tex 
```


RStudio server (note the `-u 0` to launch server as root): 

```
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -u 0 -v $(pwd):/data supervisord
```



## Configuration

### R 

See [build.R]()

### Jekyll

See [_config.yml]() in the root directory. 

### Drone

See the [.drone.yml]() file in the root directory, and the [drone.yml documentation]()

## Interactive use 

For interactive use in RStudio, link to the home directory instead:



## Files 

- [Dockerfile](): Builds on the general-purpose [rocker/hadleyverse]() container, which provides many of the basic R dependencies including pandoc. Adds additional R packages and the necessary Ruby environment for Jekyll. 
- [Gemfile](): Used by the Dockerfile. A list of gems installed on the docker image.
- [Gemfile.lock](): Used by the Dockerfile. Automatically generated by Bundler using the docker image, thereafter used to lock versions of gems
- [build.R]():
- [deploy.sh](): A script used by [../drone.yml]() to deploy the built site to Github appropriately. This must be configured to use the appropriate branches depending on whether a project repository or a user/org repository (`username.github.io`) is being used. Project repositories host the HTML from `gh-pages` branch, user repositories host from `master` the master branch.
