Perhaps searching would help?

      <div id="search">
      <form method="get" class="navbar-search form-search">
        <p>
        <input type="text" name="search-text" id="search-text">
         <button class="btn btn-mini" type="submit"><i class="icon-search"></i></button> 
        </p>
      </form>
      </div>

Still puzzled? Contact me through one of the linked icons below.
