Perhaps searching would help?

  
<div id="search">
  <form action="/search" method="get" class="navbar-search pull-left">
    <input type="text" id="search-query" class="search-query" name="q" placeholder="Search" autocomplete="off">
  </form>
</div>
<section id="search-results">
  <div class="entries">
  </div>
</section>
